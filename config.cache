# This file is a shell script that caches the results of configure
# tests run on this system so they can be shared between configure
# scripts and configure runs.  It is not useful on other systems.
# If it contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
#
# By default, configure uses ./config.cache as the cache file,
# creating it if it does not exist already.  You can give configure
# the --cache-file=FILE option to use a different cache file; that is
# what configure does when it calls configure scripts in
# subdirectories, so they share the cache.
# Giving --cache-file=/dev/null disables caching, for debugging configure.
# config.status only pays attention to the cache file if you give it the
# --recheck option to rerun configure.
